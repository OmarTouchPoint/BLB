                <p class="founder-bio-text">
                    Joey Bachrach is the visionary founder of Big Little Bows, dedicated to bringing hope and support to LGBTQ+ teens struggling with substance use disorder and mental health challenges. His own journey through addiction during his teenage years inspired him to create a program where young individuals could find the guidance and support he wished he had during his own struggles.

                    From Teenage Addiction to Visionary Leader
                </h2>
                <p class="founder-bio-text">
                    Joey's journey with addiction began during his teenage years when he struggled with alcoholism. He faced these challenges without the guidance or support of someone who truly understood what he was going through, particularly as an out teen.
                    <br><br>
                    Determined to make a difference and provide the support he lacked, Joey embarked on a mission to create a community where LGBTQ+ teens could find understanding, empathy, and mentorship.
