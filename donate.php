Additionally, your donation helps support Little Bows who have aged out of our program and are now 18+, providing financial assistance for LGBTQ+ affirming sober livings and treatment centers.

                        No one should be denied access to affirming care due to financial barriers. We understand finding affirming options that specialize in the unique needs of the LGBTQ+ community can be challenging which is why we have partnered with verified programs that specialize in affirming care.
