                A Little Bow at Big Little Bows is a brave soul embarking on a journey of self-discovery and healing. These are remarkable LGBTQ+ teens, aged 15-17. Each Little Bow is a beacon of resilience, seeking guidance as they navigate the complexities of their identity and the road to recovery. Through our program, they find not just support, but a familyâ€”a community of understanding, empathy, and unwavering encouragement. 
                <br><br>
                Matched with a Big Bow mentor who shares their journey and identity, they embark on a path of growth, empowerment, and hope. At Big Little Bows, we cherish and nurture the potential within every Little Bow, believing wholeheartedly in their ability to triumph over adversity and emerge as radiant, empowered individuals.
